          My professional goal is to become a software developer. I’ve always
          been interested in coding, however I have never actually worked in IT.
          I am really dedicated to learning and improving my skills as well as
          expanding them. Also, if I’m stuck at something, I’m not afraid to ask
          more experienced people for help, if google, documentation and
          Stackoverflow are not enough.
